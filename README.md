## Seasons Don't Fear The Reaper...

As a gesture of gratitude, I'm offering this Grim Reaper Clock screensaver that I made, to my Twitter followers to download. Just in time for Halloween 2017!

It is an actual working clock. It will synch to the system time of the PC on which it is installed. It was inspired by [_a sobering statistic I recently learned_](http://bit.ly/ReapTwt).

Simply download the [_install.the.reaper.zip_](https://github.com/phatphuk/boc/raw/master/dist/install.the.reaper.zip) file that you will find in the [_dist_](dist) folder. Unzip the installer. Run it. And you should be good-to-go.

Sorry Mac folk. It only works on Windows. Ironically, I created the clock on my Mac! But the license for my Mac screensaver utility expired.

_**Trivia question for the hardcare Prince fans**_: Can you guess what image I used for the second hand of the clock?

Got any questions, answers or suggestions, [_tweet 'em to me_](http://twitter.com/phatphukRrr).
